# AltarGMSAssetProcessor
A simple asset processor that processes GameMaker:Studio asset files after they have been extracted from the data.win file by the [Altar.NET tool](https://gitlab.com/PoroCYon/Altar.NET).

## Features
### Sprite Unpacking
Using data from the sprite, texpage and texture folders, the sprites are unpacked back into their individual sprite images.

### GIF Generation
Gif generation is an option that can be turned to generate GIFs for each sprite object (when there's more than 1 image for a sprite object).
